### Nim implementation of Circular buffers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/megawac/RingBuffer.nim.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/megawac/RingBuffer.nim)

[**Documentation**](http://rawgit.com/megawac/RingBuffer.nim/master/docs/RingBuffer.html)

> A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams.
